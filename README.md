<h3>A web solution where students in a university can select courses they want to take for the semester, and submit it.</h3>

<p>A student should first select the Faculty, and then a list of all the departments under that faculty appears in a select-box. The student then selects a department, and then all course offered by the selected department appears. Then the students select as many courses as they wish to take, which is then added to a list.</p>

<p>Use a chain drop-down to implement this feature.</p>

<p>Student are able to add multiple courses from several departments before submission.</p>

<p>When they have finished selecting all the courses they want to take, there should be a submit button, which after they click, they wonâ€™t be able to make changes to their selection</p>

<p>After this, an Admin officer should be able to login with admin credentials, view all courses submitted by each student, and also approve or reject any submission.</p>
